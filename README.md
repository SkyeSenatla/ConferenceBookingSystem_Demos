# 🏢 Conference Room Booking System

This repository contains a **practice project** used to demonstrate professional Git, GitHub, documentation, and collaboration workflows.

The project simulates a **Conference Room Booking System** that will be expanded incrementally across multiple modules to support learning around:
- Documentation and onboarding
- APIs and contracts
- Team collaboration
- System handover and communication

At this stage, the emphasis is on **process, clarity, and communication**, rather than full system implementation.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to help trainees practise **real-world software development behaviours**, including:

- Writing and improving documentation over time
- Using Pull Requests as communication and review artefacts
- Collaborating using shared sprint documentation
- Structuring a repository for long-term maintainability

The project evolves alongside the training programme, reflecting how documentation and systems grow in real teams.
